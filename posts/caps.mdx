❤️ **Powerful**: Run with styles and power!

💻 **Everything is a component**: Everything in one component.

🔧 **Customizable**: Decide which component is rendered for each markdown
element (`{ h1: MyHeading }`).

📚 **Markdown-based**: The simplicity and elegance of markdown remains,
you interleave JSX only when you want to.

🔥 **Blazingly blazing fast**: MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs
during the build stage.
